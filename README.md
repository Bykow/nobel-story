# Nobel Ntory
Digital Story around Nobel Prizes

For this project the goal was to make a digital story telling about a subject. I chose Nobel Prizes.

## Data
You will find the API I used to find my data of those prizes [here](http://api.nobelprize.org/v1/laureate.json).

In "fetchNobel.js" I preprocessed my data to create an out.csv file that I can use with D3 later on.

## Website
You can find the web site here: [Nobel Story](http://api.nobelprize.org/v1/laureate.json).

I used the [D3 library](https://d3js.org/) to make the map appear, also used a [Creative Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/) Bootstrap Template
to make the website look better. 

The JavaScript code for D3 can be found in docs > assets > js > map.js
